# Proportional-Controller-for-a-Water-tank
A demonstration of fundamental Proportional Controller using Ladder Diagram (LAD) in Siemens TIA Portal for S7 PLCs.

# üìÅ Project Contents This repository contains:

1.Proportional-Controller-for-a-Water-tank_S7_LAD (TIA Portal Project)

     Siemens project file with LAD logic implementations.

     Includes OBs, FBs, and DBs for structured programming. 

2.Proportional-Controller-for-a-Water-tank-Model_Factory_IO

     Interactive 3D simulation model (compatible with Factory I/O).

     Visualizes PLC logic in an industrial automation context.

3.Schematic Function Block Pusher.pdf

     PDF documentation of the program structure and logic flow.

     Annotated ladder diagrams for easy reference. 
     
4. Demo Video Function Block Pusher.mp4

     Step-by-step walkthrough of project operations.

     Shows real-time responses to input triggers.

# üõ†Ô∏è Requirements Software:

      Siemens TIA Portal (V16 or later).

      Factory I/O (optional, for 3D simulation). 

#   Hardware:
     Compatible S7 PLC (e.g., S7-1200/S7-1500) or PLCSIM Advanced for virtual testing.
